                  <strong>Serious infections:</strong> Avoid in patients with

                  prompt/complete diagnostic workup appropriate for
                  immunocompromised patients and initiate antimicrobials. If
                  systemic illness develops in patients who reside or travel to
                  regions where mycoses are endemic, consider empiric
                  antifungals.

                  lymphoma, were greater in TNF-blocker-treated patients.

                  (HSTCL) with combination therapy versus increased risk of
                  immunogenicity and hypersensitivity reactions with

                  interrupt treatment if drug-induced liver injury is suspected.
